# Big O Notation 🧠 – Algorithm Complexity Playground

**Big O Notation** is a simple and educational project that demonstrates the **time and space complexity** of common algorithms using **JavaScript**. It serves as a practical reference for understanding Big O notation and analyzing algorithm performance.

## 📚 About

This repository contains examples of various algorithms implemented in JavaScript, along with comments and explanations of their complexity in Big O terms (e.g., O(1), O(n), O(log n), O(n²)).

It's designed for:

- Students learning data structures and algorithms
- Developers preparing for coding interviews
- Anyone who wants to deepen their understanding of performance analysis

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Core programming language
- **Node.js** – For running and testing algorithms
- **VS Code / Console** – No UI; purely logic-focused
